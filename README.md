Data modeling for SQL and NoSQL database, APIS, and storage/interchange formats

Hackolade Studio is a comprehensive data modeling platform that supports a wide variety of technologies, including RDBMS platforms (e.g., Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server), cloud-native analytics databases (e.g., BigQuery, Databricks, Snowflake), NoSQL databases (like MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, Neo4j), API modeling (REST/OpenAPI, GraphQL), data interchange formats (JSON, Avro, Parquet), and metadata catalogs (Unity Catalog, Collibra). Originally known for its NoSQL support, it has since expanded into a leading solution for managing and evolving data schemas across the modern data ecosystem.

The Hackolade Model Hub is a model-driven metadata collaboration platform that offers centralized, streamlined access to your Hackolade Studio data models, stored across one or more Git repositories.  A model-driven metadata collaboration platform allows organizations to retake control of their data.
