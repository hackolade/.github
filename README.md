Data modeling for SQL and NoSQL database, APIS, and storage/interchange formats

Hackolade Studio is a comprehensive data modeling platform that supports a wide variety of technologies, including NoSQL databases (like MongoDB, Couchbase), RDBMS platforms (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), cloud-native analytics databases (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery), API modeling (REST/OpenAPI, GraphQL), data interchange formats (JSON, Avro, Parquet), and metadata catalogs (Unity Catalog, Collibra). Originally known for its NoSQL support, it has since expanded into a leading solution for managing and evolving data schemas across the modern data ecosystem.
